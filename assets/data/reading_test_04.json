This has\naffected all levels of data storage, from the grandest government archives to the\nlargest corporations and educational institutions all the way down to personal\njournals and family financial records. On the one hand, this transformation of the\nway that data is stored offers tremendous environmental advantages: much more\ndata can be stored in a much smaller physical space and yet is more-easily\navailable to more people. There is no need to print pages and then physically\nstore them. More and better-organized information is more easily available\nwithout storage problems. Have we reached some kind of“infotopia”? Perhaps,\nbut there is a serious downside, and that is the problem of document security.\nComputer systems, which are mostly continuously connected to the Internet, are\nall too prone to being hacked. This can be done for criminal reasons or simply\nbecause of the satisfaction that hackers get from cracking apparently secure\ninformation systems. New opportunities for theft, espionage, blackmail, and\npolitical dirty tricks are already in existence."

When I checked out on June\n20, I was in such a hurry to get to the airport that I didn’t closely look at the hotel\nbill I was presented. I was therefore surprised when I checked out my receipts\nthis morning and noticed that I had been charged a fee for consuming food and\nbeverages from the minibar.\nIn all of my stays at your hotel, I have never once taken anything from there.\nThis is also true of my most recent stay. I would appreciate your looking into the\nsituation and removing the extra charge from my credit card.\nThank you.\nJarvis Campbell\nTo: jcampbell@duncanoil.com\nFrom: frontdesk@maybellhotel.com\nDate: June 24\nSubject: Re: Bill\nDear Mr. Campbell,\n958\n\nWe thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. We immediately\nlooked into it. Unfortunately, the cleaning person who checked your room after\nyou departed, Gloria Soto, resigned her position the following day, so we weren’t\nable to interview in person.\nHowever, after checking your past records, we confirmed that in nearly\nmonthly stays over the past 5 years, you have not used the minibar, so we\nrefunded that amount to your credit card. In addition, the next time you stay with\nus, we will upgrade you from a double room to a suite at no extra charge. We\nhope you consider this an acceptable apology from us.\nSincerely,\nHenrietta Sanchez\nFront Desk Manager, Maybell Hotel"
