Soon after the crew started work, there were many\nsigns that warned me of bad things to come. I realize now that I should have taken\nthose signs seriously and put a stop to the project to minimize the damage that it\nhas since caused.\nIn summary, the entire project has been a huge catastrophe. Firstly, the crew\nshowed little professionalism by being late in meeting their starting times on a\ndaily basis and took long breaks during crucial stages, which caused extra work\nfor everyone else. As well, certain areas requiring supervision were left\nunattended for long periods of time, and considerable garbage was left in areas\nthat were not designated for waste removal.\nThese issues have caused much stress to our employees and reduced the\nproductivity of our office over these weeks. Our staff has expressed their\ndiscomfort, their feelings of being unsafe and have wasted precious time cleaning\nup after your company’s crew instead of doing their regular work.\nMr. Warner, I have left many messages about this on your voice-mail but\nhave not heard back. I am astonished and extremely disappointed at the\nperformance and quality of the work being done and the lack of responsiveness\nfrom your company to my calls.\nThis letter serves to confirm the immediate end to your company’s contract\nwith us. Your crew will no longer be allowed on our premises, and please do not\nexpect payment for any work completed to date!\nDavid Martin\nPanorama Systems, General Manager\ndlmartin@panorsys.org\nTo: dlmartin@panorsys.org\nFrom: twarner@warnerinc.net\nSubject: Service termination\n1119\n\nDear Mr. Martin,\nMy sincerest apologies for the service issues your company has endured. I\nhave been out of the office on a family emergency and have been unable to\nretrieve my messages in the few days.\nI have just returned and have listened to your messages and read your letter.\nThere is no excuse for the lack of professionalism and poor performance\nshown by the crew from our organization. The assigned crew was a new team\nsubcontracted from a source that I thought was very reliable. Normally, our senior\nsupervisor would have worked alongside the crew on this project but, due to\nextenuating circumstances, could not. I am shocked and severely sorry for the\ntroubles this has caused, and to the reputation of my company.\nPlease accept my deepest apologies and our offer to complete the work\nproperly immediately – with payment for hard costs only. (Our labor and other\nfees will be waived entirely.) You have my personal commitment that the project\nwill be completed at the highest quality with my direct supervision.\nI will give you a call in the morning hopefully to be able to discuss this\nproposal with you and to convince you to allow us to finish this project.\nBest Regards,\nTony Warner\nWarner Associates Inc."

I wonder if you have any homes that\nwould fit our needs. Ideally, my children would each have a room of their own,\nand we wouldn’t spend more than $175,000.
