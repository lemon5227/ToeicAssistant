The reason is because, as you may well know, Safenet is a\ncompany that specializes in Internet security appliances, especially in the area of\nfirewall applications, and we are currently looking for some new technology that\ncould add to our protection on a network level. Therefore, I was glad to receive\nan email message from you. I know that with Internet security protection on both\nthe application and network level, we could introduce a phenomenal product by\nworking together.\nAfter talking to some of my colleagues, I learned that Security Systems has\ndone some outstanding research and development in the area of Internet security\non the network level, especially in host prevention systems. We currently have a\nworking relationship with a vendor doing similar protection systems on Linux-\nbased systems. This does not necessarily imply that we cannot work together with\nSecurity Systems. In fact, if everything works out, we are more than willing to\nswitch over and let you handle all the work in the future.\nPlease send me a roadmap of our product development, a business proposal\nwith details of possible collaboration, and also full product details with technical\nspecifications and a brochure to start with.\nI’m looking forward to your reply.\n1067\n\nAndrew Kennedy\nDirector of R&D, Safenet"

In those days, the transmitting of information using short signals or\nbinary code was impossible. Samuel F. B. Morse’s invention brought about the\nenhancement of telegraphs, the further development of binary code, and the\nadoption of electromagnetism into this transmission technology.\nModels of the first telegraph and the early days of the electrical telegraph\nwill be displayed at the exhibition. Portraits and paintings of historic scenes by\nSamuel F. B. Morse will be on display as well. We will be giving free\ndemonstrations of Morse code transmission and providing a full explanation of\nthe development of binary code. We will also be giving out small booklets on\nMorse code to children to understand Morse code in a fun way.\nThere will also be some film clips and talks that will give visitors a deeper\nunderstanding of Morse’s life. It will be shown to visitors at the end of the tour so\nthat everyone can fully grasp the meaning of the exhibition.\nThe exhibition will commence from May 1 through July 30 at the Franklin\nMuseum of Telegraphy. Tickets are available at $20 for adults, $10 for children\nbelow the age of 12, and a group rate of $100 for 10 or more people. Children\n1077\n\nbelow the age of 5 get in for free.

However, I was wondering if the exhibition is\nhandicapped friendly and provides easy access to wheelchair-bound people like\nmy brother. We also have a friend from China who is visiting us and will come\nalong to the exhibition. He is not very familiar with the English language and\nAmerican culture. May I ask if there are brochures or explanation materials in\nlanguages other than English? Are translations provided during the video clips\nand talks as well?\nThank You,\nBen Hawkins"

This year, Christine Felt organized the trip.“While\nI’ve visited Camden Grounds before, this was my first time to arrange everything\nfor the trip. Fortunately, the contact person there did a great job and helped us\nhave a wonderful time.”\nDuring the three-day trip there, staffers rode on horses and participated in\nother outdoor activities. It wasn’t all fun and games though as they attended\nseveral workshops and listened to lectures by guest speakers.\nhttp://www.camdengrounds.com\nI visited Camden Grounds for the first time with my colleagues from Harper\nManufacturing two weeks ago. I had heard many positive remarks about it from\nthem, and it turns out that they hadn’t been exaggerating. Visiting Camden\nGrounds was a truly amazing experience. I particularly enjoyed the hikes, the spa,\nand the food at the restaurant. The only drawback was that the prices were\nsomewhat out of my range. My company paid for everything, so I didn’t have to\nworry about the cost of this trip, but I doubt I can afford to stay there on my own\nin the future.\n- Marybeth Simmons"

(I have attached the ad to verify the validity of the sales promotion\non a nationwide level.) I wanted to spend some time shopping at your store, so I\nleft my office early. But to my dismay, instead of a wonderful shopping\nexperience, I found the promotion ad not entirely valid and a poor customer\nservice store attendant.\nFrom the printed ad, I was led to believe that every item in the store was\n1080\n\n20% off the regular price. Unfortunately, I discovered that items that were on\ndiscount applied only to those that were labeled with a“SALE” sticker in the\nstore. In this case, not more than ten items were on sale. I thought this\ncontradicted to the ad published. I therefore challenged the store attendant with a\ncopy of the ad I had brought. To my surprise, I was told that the discount on all\nitems was not applicable to the store on Harrison Street. I was then referred to the\nstore manager after insisting that the ad mentioned a nationwide sale. The\nmanager did not bother to resolve the issue but insisted, with a very unwilling\nattitude, that the ad was a mistake! I left the store fuming without a single\npurchase.\nI have been a faithful customer of your store for a very long time, but the\nexperience I had, along with my encounter with the staff at the store on Harrison\nStreet, is just not acceptable.\nJohn Waikinson"
