The reason is because, as you may well know, Safenet is a\ncompany that specializes in Internet security appliances, especially in the area of\nfirewall applications, and we are currently looking for some new technology that\ncould add to our protection on a network level. Therefore, I was glad to receive\nan email message from you. I know that with Internet security protection on both\nthe application and network level, we could introduce a phenomenal product by\nworking together.\nAfter talking to some of my colleagues, I learned that Security Systems has\ndone some outstanding research and development in the area of Internet security\non the network level, especially in host prevention systems. We currently have a\nworking relationship with a vendor doing similar protection systems on Linux-\nbased systems. This does not necessarily imply that we cannot work together with\nSecurity Systems. In fact, if everything works out, we are more than willing to\nswitch over and let you handle all the work in the future.\nPlease send me a roadmap of our product development, a business proposal\nwith details of possible collaboration, and also full product details with technical\nspecifications and a brochure to start with.\nI’m looking forward to your reply.\n1067\n\nAndrew Kennedy\nDirector of R&D, Safenet"

In those days, the transmitting of information using short signals or\nbinary code was impossible. Samuel F. B. Morse’s invention brought about the\nenhancement of telegraphs, the further development of binary code, and the\nadoption of electromagnetism into this transmission technology.\nModels of the first telegraph and the early days of the electrical telegraph\nwill be displayed at the exhibition. Portraits and paintings of historic scenes by\nSamuel F. B. Morse will be on display as well. We will be giving free\ndemonstrations of Morse code transmission and providing a full explanation of\nthe development of binary code. We will also be giving out small booklets on\nMorse code to children to understand Morse code in a fun way.\nThere will also be some film clips and talks that will give visitors a deeper\nunderstanding of Morse’s life. It will be shown to visitors at the end of the tour so\nthat everyone can fully grasp the meaning of the exhibition.\nThe exhibition will commence from May 1 through July 30 at the Franklin\nMuseum of Telegraphy. Tickets are available at $20 for adults, $10 for children\nbelow the age of 12, and a group rate of $100 for 10 or more people. Children\n1077\n\nbelow the age of 5 get in for free.
