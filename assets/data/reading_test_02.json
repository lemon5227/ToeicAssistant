I put the\nquestion to analysts at the Real Estate Institute, who came up with the following\nobservations:\n• Women no longer seek marriage and a homemaking role as their first\npriority, but want a stable job or career instead, and this puts them in a position\nwhere they can own a home independently. —[2]—\n• Single men are no longer pressured to“settle down,” which traditionally\nmeans getting a stable job with a career path and then getting married and buying\na house. —[3]— They tend, therefore, to be less likely to have stable jobs.\n• Women are increasingly better qualified and in many areas have surpassed\nmen. This enables them to obtain better and more highly paid jobs.\n• Women seem to be more capable of seeking good advice and completing\nthe formalities of obtaining a mortgage. —[4]—\nExperts at the institute expect the trend to continue, as home ownership\nprovides financial and emotional security for women who are not yet ready to\nseek a“partner for life.”\nJeanette Jones"

You’ve been chosen to represent us\nwith Scofield Manufacturing. It just so happens that Marty was planning to fly to\nZurich to discuss an issue in our contract with them. You need to fly there in his\nplace. I’ll have Zachary Morris make your travel arrangements and book a room\nfor you. He’ll get in touch with you within the hour. In addition, you should be in\nmy office today at 1:00 P.M. so that I can tell you everything I know about\nScofield. You’ll have to review several files prior to meeting with them. It won’t\nbe easy, but I’m sure you’re up for the challenge.\nRegards,\nRon\nRonald Salt [11:04 A.M.]\n869\n\nHi, Deborah. Anything to report?\nDeborah Hatfield [11:06 A.M.]\nI’ve been meeting with the people at Scofield for the past two days. They’re\nmostly happy with the work we’re doing, but they want to renegotiate the contract.\nRonald Salt [11:07 A.M.]\nDid they say why?\nDeborah Hatfield [11:08 A.M.]\nThey’re convinced they’re being overcharged. They’re threatening to cancel\nthe entire contract if we don’t lower the price.\nRonald Salt [11:09 A.M.]\nOkay, tell them to wait a bit. I’m sending Lon Meadows there. He’s our lead\naccountant and is familiar with the contract. He should be there sometime\ntomorrow morning.\nDeborah Hatfield [11:10 A.M.]\nThanks. I’ll inform Mr. Jurgen and ask him to be patient.\nhttp://www.dresden.com\nSeveral Employees Receive Promotions\n(November 19) – Several Dresden, Inc. employees were recently promoted\nfor their outstanding performances.
