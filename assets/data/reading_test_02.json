I put the\nquestion to analysts at the Real Estate Institute, who came up with the following\nobservations:\n• Women no longer seek marriage and a homemaking role as their first\npriority, but want a stable job or career instead, and this puts them in a position\nwhere they can own a home independently. —[2]—\n• Single men are no longer pressured to“settle down,” which traditionally\nmeans getting a stable job with a career path and then getting married and buying\na house. —[3]— They tend, therefore, to be less likely to have stable jobs.\n• Women are increasingly better qualified and in many areas have surpassed\nmen. This enables them to obtain better and more highly paid jobs.\n• Women seem to be more capable of seeking good advice and completing\nthe formalities of obtaining a mortgage. —[4]—\nExperts at the institute expect the trend to continue, as home ownership\nprovides financial and emotional security for women who are not yet ready to\nseek a“partner for life.”\nJeanette Jones"
