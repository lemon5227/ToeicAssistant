Two couples intent on a romantic Venetian holiday accidentally\nmeet. They spend time together and... you guessed it: there are unexpected\nchemical reactions. The problem is that the script and acting are so poor that we\ncouldn’t care less about any of the protagonists! Not recommended. • M.H.\nRED RAIN\nIf you enjoy horror movies where city slickers unintentionally get stuck in\nsinister country towns, this movie is for you. Red Rain is a finely crafted effort\nfrom one of the masters of schlock-horror, Jim Middleton. There’s nothing new in\nthe plot, but the special effects, décor, and script are excellent, and the acting,\nmostly by unknowns, is also first-rate. ••• 1/2 Jane Stevenson"

Hopefully, you can\nput them to good use on a few of research projects we’re going to be involved in.\nI’m looking forward to seeing you again on the second of March.\n1002\n\nSincerely,\nFred Sweitzer"
