The new design meets your technical\nspecifications with the capabilities to interface with third party software and\nscalability to support different languages. One minor issue about the design of the\nsoftware is that the file size is larger than what you were expecting. I hope this\ndoes not affect your final plans for packaging and marketing the product.\nI have attached the source code for your perusal.

I am interested in the LG DVD Player LG6800. However,\nwhen I tried to purchase the item online, I realized that the item for this particular\nmodel is not available at the moment. I would like to confirm my order for this\nDVD player.\nIs it possible for your company to advise me on the availability date of this\nDVD player? Will it still be $180.00?\nAs for the shipping charges, it is written on the website that for all purchases\nabove $80, there will be no shipping charges. Presumably that the cost of $180\nincludes shipping. Is there any shipping insurance coverage on the shipment? I\nhad some bad experiences earlier this year with some e-commerce retailers.\nMany of the orders I received were in bad or damaged conditions. I want to\nensure that the item is insured for this order, as it might get damaged or\nmishandled during transit.\nThank you!\nLynn\n1199"
