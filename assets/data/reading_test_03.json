While no\nofficial figures have been released by either firm, the deal is believed to worth in\nthe vicinity of $145 million.\nUntil recently, Gaz International had been seeking to expand its exploration\nand refining operations, but it has reportedly been frustrated by local regulatory\nbodies. —[1]—\nYevgeni Star, which has some cross-share holdings with large industrial\ncorporations in related and unrelated fields, notably in the energy and\nshipbuilding sectors, will become one of Russian’s leading players in the vital\nstrategic area of energy supplies. —[2]—\nExplaining the reasons for the sale, Gaz International CEO Fritz Faschier\ntold reporters yesterday,“Our board of directors believes that this is the ideal time\nto consolidate our operations by concentrating on less-risky investments while at\nthe same time boosting our interests in research and development. I mean, in\nparticular, research into alternative fuels and energy sources. I have no doubt that\nthis deal is in the interests of both parties.”\nIt is known that the deal includes significant technology transfers. —[3]— A\nteam of Gaz International engineers and administrators will train Yevgeni\nengineers in the operation of exploration and extraction technology developed by\nthe international giant.\nYevgeni Star operators were also keen to acquire Gaz International’s license\n899\n\nto explore and develop northern oil fields until 2025. The current production of\n10,000 barrels a day is expected to at least double over the next 5 years.\nDue to the complex nature of legal arrangements surrounding the transfer of\nlicenses and technological information, the deal is not expected to be sewn up\nbefore January of next year. —[4]— Approval for the license transfer must be\nnegotiated with Russian authorities while several major Swiss banks will vet the\nfinancial arrangements and the details of technology transfer."

For serious issues and emergencies, the\npeople of this town of 10,000 have been forced to travel to Piedmont, which has\ntwo large hospitals. However, that is going to change in May when the Powell\nHospital opens its doors.\nAdrian Desmond, a longtime resident of Watertown, is the man behind\nPowell Hospital.“I love this town, and I thought long and hard about how to make\nit better. I decided that constructing a hospital would be the best way for me to\naccomplish this.” Local residents agree as they can’t stop thanking Mr. Desmond\nwhenever they see him on the town’s streets.“It’s hard for me to drive more than\nan hour to get to a hospital,” commented local resident Dale Sweeney.“It will be\nnice to be able to walk down the street the next time something ails me.”\nThe opening of the hospital comes at a crucial time since Dr. Edith\nFairmount is considering shutting down the Watertown Health Clinic. Without the\nhospital, that would leave the area with no professional medical services.\nTo: Clarence Harper\nFrom: Mark Portland\nSubject: Position\nDate: April 29\nDear Mr. Harper,\nIt was a pleasure to speak with you yesterday. I was satisfied with the terms\nof your offer and would like to inform you that I’m looking forward to working at\nPowell Hospital on the day it opens.
