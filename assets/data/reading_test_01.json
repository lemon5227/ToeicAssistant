If unsure about how to\naddress them, it is okay to ask how they would like to be called. For example, if it\nis impolite in your country to call someone elder by their first name, ask if it’s\nokay to add Mr. or Mrs. in front of their names. —[1]—\n• Show your family that you are grateful for being your host. But do not give\nexpensive gifts. It is, however, considered appropriate to bring inexpensive\nhandcrafts from your country or a small gift for the children of the host family.\n• Your host family will be curious to know more about you. —[2]— Bring\nphotos of your family and friends to share with them. This is also a great way to\nbreak the ice with them. —[3]—\n• After you get settled, your host family will help you make a call to your\nparents to assure them that you have arrived safely.\n• After you’ve had dinner, you may ask the host family to be excused early.\nThey will be fully aware of the fact that you might be jet-lagged, so feel free to\nask them.\nOn your first day of school:\n• On your first day of school, your host family will take you to school and\nhelp you with the necessary registration paperwork.\n• Your host family will also make sure that you know your way to and from\nschool. They will also teach you how to use public transportation. —[4]—\n• When traveling alone, you should at all times carry a map and the phone\nnumber of your host family.\n803\n\n• In case you are lost and cannot get in touch with your host family, you can\ncontact the“Homestay Network”."

We have relied on Ultra-Ergonomic Furniture for\npurchase and rental supplies of high-quality furniture for that entire period, and\nwe’ve never had any cause for complaints with regard to your services.\nI am writing to you personally to ask a special favor. We recently made an\norder with your company for the supply of rental furniture that includes chairs,\ntables, partitions, and lecterns for an auto show (see order no. 11-35698A).\nUnfortunately, a serious error was made. In fact the exposition begins one week\nearlier than indicated on the order form. The starting date is actually July 7. I\nwould appreciate it very much if you could try to do everything you can to ensure\nthat our order be delivered to us on that date. Also, if possible, I’d like to add 20\nPop-up displays on top of our original order.\nI realize that this is a big favor to ask, but on the basis of our long-term\nbusiness relationship, I hope that you will be able to find a way.\nI’m really sorry for any inconvenience. Please contact me soon.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Robinson\nMichael Robinson\nProperties Manager\nmrobinson@btc.com\nFrom: srogers@uef.shipping.com\nSent: June 8, 2018\nTo: mrobinson@btc.com\n817\n\nSubject: Your request\nDear Mr. Robinson,\nThank you for your letter. I was surprised, and of course concerned, that you\nfind yourself in this unfortunate situation. And of course I will do my best to help\nyou. Your company has been one of our best clients since we began operations in\n1978.\nAnyway, I personally took a trip down to our warehouse this morning to\nhave a closer look at our stock to see if we have all the things you need for your\nconvention — which I believe is from July 7 to July 14. I am happy to say that we\nwill be able to provide you with everything you originally requested. However,\nas for the additional request you made, it won’t be possible because we have\nalready rented them out to another client during that week.\nMy suggestion is that you come down to my office to discuss other\npossibilities. I can take you down to our warehouse, and you can look at our\ninventory. So, please call me soon to arrange a time.\nKind regards,\nSuzanne Rogers,\nSales and Shipping Department"
