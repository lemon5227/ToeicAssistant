In fact the exposition begins one week\nearlier than indicated on the order form. The starting date is actually July 7.

I am happy to say that we\nwill be able to provide you with everything you originally requested. However,\nas for the additional request you made, it won’t be possible because we have\nalready rented them out to another client during that week.\nMy suggestion is that you come down to my office to discuss other\npossibilities. I can take you down to our warehouse, and you can look at our\ninventory. So, please call me soon to arrange a time.\nKind regards,\nSuzanne Rogers,\nSales and Shipping Department"

I thoroughly enjoyed my\ntime at the event and made several purchases for myself and others. Unfortunately,\nthe desk which I bought has a problem. When I set it up at home, one of the legs\nfell off. It can’t be reattached, so I can’t use it. I wonder if it would be possible to\n826\n\nget my money refunded. I’ll be visiting the community center to attend my arts and\ncrafts class tomorrow, so perhaps I can have a chat with you in the afternoon.\nRegards,\nGreg Stein"

This year, we are\nplanning to be in my hometown from July 15 to 25. Almost everyone in my\nextended family intends to show up at some point, so it would be great if you saw\nfit to approve my request for time off. I have attached the request form I picked up\nfrom HR today. I scanned it onto my computer since I know you’re out of the\noffice all day.\nIn addition, I thought I’d let you know the work on the Marconi project is\ngoing well. I received the files I requested from the courthouse, so I’m currently\nlooking over them. If I find anything of interest, I shall inform you at once.\nRegards,\nClarice Valiant\nTo: Clarice Valiant <cvaliant@vanderhouse.com>\nFrom: Regina Paul <rpaul@vanderhouse.com>\nSubject: Re: July Trip\nDate: Thursday, July 5\nClarice,\nI received your e-mail and the form you uploaded. Unfortunately, you failed\nto include any information regarding who will take care of the work you normally\ndo while you’re away. As a result, I must decline your request for time off.\nHowever, if you can provide me with a written plan before the day is over, I will\n829\n\nbe open to reconsidering my response.\nSincerely,\nRegina Paul"
