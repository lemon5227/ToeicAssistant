前言
TOEIC考试（Test of English for International Communication）是ETS（美
国教育考试服务中心）专为母语非英语人士设计的英语能力考试。它是目前
全球规模最大的职场英语能力考试，在全球90多个国家和地区实施，拥有
9000个以上的超大型企业客户，年考试量超过500万人次。TOEIC在企业界
被广泛使用，作为英语培训绩效标准、员工招募、外派或驻外人员筛选标准
及晋升的必要条件。优秀的TOEIC考试成绩已经成为进入外企的一块敲门
砖。
新TOEIC考试的听力包含四部分内容，共100题，考试时间为45分钟。
题型包括：照片描述、应答问题、简短对话及简短文章。阅读包含三部分内
容，共100题，考试时间为75分钟。题型包括：完成句子、短文填空、阅读
理解。新TOEIC阅读及听力考试除了维持既有的信度和效度水准外，更能体
现并贴近实际沟通情景的测试理念。
TOEIC考试并没有所谓的“通过”或“不通过”，而是将考生的英语能力以
听力5~495分、阅读5~495分，总分10~990分的分数来呈现。考生可以由此
得知自己的英语能力，也可以为自己设定目标分数。
为了帮助广大考生更好地了解TOEIC考试的要求和特点，迅速夯实语言
基础，提高应试技能，我们推出了一系列与TOEIC考试相关的辅导用书。这
些图书均由具有多年TOEIC考试培训经验的专家编写，主要包括：《托业词
汇词根+联想记忆法》、《托业实战训练1000题（一）》、《托业实战训练
1000题（二）》、《托业听力专项突破》、《托业阅读专项突破》等。这些
图书一经出版，就获得了各地考生的广泛赞誉，成为备战TOEIC考试的首选
复习资料。不过，除了词汇类、听力/阅读单项类及综合指导类图书之外，
许多考生还希望能有高仿真的模拟试题集，以供在基础复习和考前冲刺阶段
进行练习。因此，我们从韩国多乐园出版社引进了《托业听力全真模拟1000
题》和《托业阅读全真模拟1000题》。这两本习题集均由在韩国执教托业考
试培训多年的辅导专家执笔编写，是韩国最畅销的托业书之一。
《托业听力全真模拟1000题》包含10套高度仿真的听力题目，涵盖了托
业听力经常考查的句式、话题和场景。解析部分不仅附有听力原文及选项的
全文翻译，而且还针对其中出现的重点词汇、短语和句型进行了系统归纳和
扩展，以帮助考生达到举一反三的学习效果。
《托业阅读全真模拟1000题》包含10套高度仿真的阅读题目，涵盖了托

还提供了文章及题目的翻译，以及从篇章中提炼出的大量词汇和短语，方便
考生在做题之后进行系统地学习，打好语言基础，查缺补漏。
考生既可以用这两本习题集在TOEIC备考的初始阶段进行自测练习，以
8

了解自己当前的英语水平，找出不足之处，从而进行有针对性的学习，也可
以在考前冲刺阶段进行强化训练和模考练习。
希望这两本高品质的习题集能够帮助广大考生取得优异的托业成绩！

如何准备托业听力
许多人对于听力练习存在认识上的误区；认为练习听力就是播放录音用
耳朵听。虽然每天坚持下来也能听懂文章的内容，但是只要发音稍有不同或
者出现一点新的内容就又听不懂了。
其实，良好的听力水平是日常沟通的重要前提。如果想要听懂对方的英
语，首先要听清楚语音语调，还要熟悉词汇和语法结构，然后在头脑中迅速
将听到的内容进行转化。只有这样才能够切实提高听力水平，从而真正提高
英语的应用能力。
那么应该如何学习托业听力呢？首先我们要明白，不是说认真地学了一
天、一星期、一个月就能完全听懂英语了。扎扎实实地训练了几个月后，在
某一瞬间听到的英语马上能在头脑中转化，从那时起英语就真的变得有趣
了。
如果想真正听懂英语，就要从基础开始学习。许多人觉得托业听力的
PART 1“照片描述”部分很简单，就马马虎虎地过一遍，这其实是一种错误的
学习方法。不能因为听的内容简短就不重视，而要在100%地完全听懂后再
进行下一阶段的学习。请先牢记本书中出现的词汇和语法，在做完题目之后
跟读，并且背诵每个答案选项。接下来大声跟读直到熟练为止（跟读阶段很
重要。虽然不用考虑文章大意，看似很容易做到。但是不看文章将内容用自
己的话说出来，就证明这段文章的语法和大意已经在你头脑中整理好了）。
请在按照这种方式完全听懂PART 1之后，再按照以下的步骤学习
其余的托业听力部分。
第一步：做题。
第二步：听写。以便使自己了解哪些部分没有听明白。
第三步：对照原文理解文章大意。如果有不懂的单词或词组，一
定要查阅字典。
第四步：听录音内容。朗读者在读文章时会出现连读、弱读等各
种现象，所以听整段的文章不同于听一个单词。要找出这部分并确认
发音方式，如有自己不能听懂的部分，可以请教英语老师或者精通英
语的朋友。
第五步：重听录音内容。请在原文中标注朗读者在哪些部分停
顿，在哪些部分重读。这需要反复听录音内容，如有听不清楚的地方
可以请教别人。
第六步：练习朗读。例如，The man is walking/across the
10

road. 读这句话时应在动词（walking）和名词（road）上加强语气，
要读得稍微长一些、重一些。首先，练习一口气读完The man is
walking。然后加上across the road进行连读。这样就会自然而然地
形成节拍，这就是语调（intonation）练习。
第七步：朗读练习结束后，合上书本不看原文试着把文章大意说
出来。如果自己练习感到无趣的话，不妨找搭档练习。练习必须达到
能自然地向对方提问的程度。如果能做到这一点，不仅在听的时候能
够理解内容，而且还能够把英语说得很流利。
如果按照这种方法学习听力，肯定要花费很多力气。但是如果你能坚持
练习几个月，就肯定能够发现自己的听力水平有极大的提高。“有志者事竟
成”，请广大考生踏踏实实地认真坚持下去，一定会有显著的成效。
最后，本书中出现的试题及词汇、短语，都不是我随意编著的，而是基
于多年来对托业试题研究的成果，是将托业考试中出现最频繁的试题类型和
语言点所做的汇总。因此，只要将本书完全消化理解，不仅能够提高托业考
试成绩，更有利于在职场中正确、熟练地使用商务英语。祝愿大家在认真学
习之后都能考出满意的托业分数，成为能在职场上自如运用英语的英语达
人。

听力试题类型及答题攻略
12

13

Part 1 照片描述（Photographs）
这部分有6道题，每题会有一张照片，你会听到针对每张照片所做的四
段描述，每题只播放一次，播放内容不会印在试题本上。考生要从四个选项
中选择将照片描述得最完整、正确的句子。本部分除美式发音外，还会有英
国、加拿大和澳洲发音。答题说明的播放时间大约为90秒，回答每道题的时
间约为5秒。
答题攻略 Part 1是托业听力考试中相对容易得分的部分，但是新托业考
试中该部分由原来的10道题减少为6道题，这种变化对于以往成绩在600分以
下的考生来说相对不利。并且，在之前的美式发音基础上又增加了英国、加
拿大和澳洲发音，对还没有熟悉多国口音的考生来说，错选的可能性也会增
加。因此除了要注意照片描述中可能出现的陷阱之外，还要熟悉多国口音，
从而保证在其他部分也能够取得更多的分数。
学习要领
1.注意照片描述
·注意只通过观察照片无法确定推测方向的正确描述
·注意有相似发音而容易混淆的描述
2.需要熟悉多国的口音
·利用英国BBC广播（www.bbc.co.uk）和澳洲ABC广播
（www.abc.net.au）来熟悉英国和澳洲的口音
·利用本书来熟悉美国、英国、加拿大和澳洲的发音差别
3.将Part 1的失误最小化，并争取在其他部分也取得更高的分数。
4.平时在观看照片或图像时，试着将其内容用简短的英语来表述。
5.反复朗读答案册中的Possible Answers。
14

15

Part 2 应答问题（Question ＆ Response）
此部分共25道题，每题包括一个问题以及三种不同回答，问题及三个选
项都只播放一次，且都不会印在试题本上。试题本上只显示试题序号
和“Mark your answer on your answer sheet.”除美式发音外，还会有英国、加拿
大和澳洲发音。答题说明的播放时间大约为60秒，回答每道题的时间约为5
秒。
7. Why did you get back from your trip so early?
（A）Because the meeting got canceled.
（B）Next Friday at the earliest.
（C）I'll be taking the train.
7. Mark your answer on your answer sheet.
8. Mark your answer on your answer sheet.
9. Mark your answer on your answer sheet.
10. Mark your answer on your answer sheet.
11. Mark your answer on your answer sheet.
12. Mark your answer on your answer sheet.
答题攻略 Part 2是通过最基础的提问-回答形式来测试考生基本的听力
和会话能力。以who, what, why, when, where, which, how开头的疑问句出现得
最多，当然也会出现以系动词和助动词开头的疑问句。并且在新托业考试
中，听陈述句找相应答案的试题也增加了一些。所以要正确分辨出是以疑问
词开头的提问，还是回答Yes/No的提问，还是以陈述句方式的提问。此外，
由于对话者的国籍不同，在同一道试题中也会出现提问是美式发音，回答却
是英式发音，请考生们一定要注意这一点。
学习要领
1.准确把握提问方式。
·要判断好是以疑问词开头的提问，还是回答Yes/No提问，还是陈述
句。
·如果是以疑问词开头的问句，就需要把握好疑问词的种类。
2.熟悉基本的提问-回答模式。
·以疑问词开头的提问，绝不选Yes/No回答。
16

·以A or B形式提问的选择疑问句，绝不选Yes/No回答。
·遇到陈述句开头的提问，千万不要慌张。
3.需要熟悉多国的口音。
4.平时找搭档练习一问一答的对话。
5.活用答案册中的Paraphrased Q＆A部分，培养实战应用能力。
17

18

Part 3 简短对话（Short Conversations）
在这个部分，你会听到两人或三人之间的简短对话，每段对话对应三道
与对话内容有关的试题，每题有四个选项，考生需要从中选择最适当的答
案。对话只播放一次，对话内容不会印在试题本上，但题目和选项都会印在
试题本上。本部分美式发音以外的对话约占70%，但提问通常是以美式发音
出现。答题说明的播放时间大约为30秒，回答每道题的时间约为8秒钟。
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.
M1: Have you decided on whether you are going to apply
for the job that's opened up in marketing?
M2: I thought it over, and I don't think I am going to
apply for it because the position doesn't pay as much as I
had thought.
M1: That's true, but there is a great chance for a quick
promotion there. If I were you, I'd think it over again
because in a couple of years you'll be in much better
situation than you would have been if you had stayed here.
M2: Hmm... I think you have a point there. Maybe I should
try to see if I can get the position first. After all, I
might not even be considered for it.
32. Who most likely are they?
（A）A job candidate and an interviewer.
（B）A marketing manager and a personnel manager.
（C）Co-workers who work in the same department of a company.
（D）A client and a shop employee.
33. Why is the man reluctant to transfer to another department?
（A）He is happy with his current job.
（B）He feels that he is not qualified for the open position.
（C）He doesn't like the people in the Marketing Department.
（D）He would have to accept a pay cut if he got hired.
34. What will the man probably do?
（A）Put in his application and face the outcome.
（B）Talk to his boss about getting more details about the position.
（C）Disregard the opportunity and wait for another time.
19

（D）Work harder to be considered for the next promotion.
答题攻略 新托业听力Part 3 最大的变化是增加三人对话题与图表搭配
题，且对话比以前稍长一些，然后再回答三个问题。这样就需要考生默记更
长的对话内容，所以在对话播放前一定要先看问题，其中有三段对话需要阅
读题目册上的图表。在平时练习时，找出各问题的答案后要进行标记。这部
分的提问形式都是以疑问词开头，这点不难掌握。其中出现最多的是以what
疑问词开头的提问，需要考生听完全部内容后才能回答出来。
学习要领
1.听对话前先看提问，预测听的重点。
·先看提问
·掌握提问模式
2.掌握对话整体内容。
·注意听最常出现的what提问
3.需要熟悉多国的口音。
·平时多看英语发音的连续剧或者电影，熟悉不同口音的对话
4.活用答案册中的Paraphrasing Practice部分，熟悉不同的表达方式。

Part 4 简短文章（Short Talks）
在这个部分，你会听到几段简短的独白，每段独白内容会对应三道试
题，每题有四个选项，请从中选择最适当的答案。每段独白内容只播放一
次，且不会印在试题本上，但题目和选项都会印在试题本上。在这部分，美
式发音以外的试题约占70%，但提问通常是以美式发音出现。文章内容的播
放时间为30秒左右，解答每道题的时间约为8秒钟。

答题攻略 对于那些听完英文后理解速度慢的考生来说，Part 4一直是得
分较难的部分。新托业听力Part 4最大的变化是增加图表搭配题。这部分和

不同种类说明文的结构及内容。

Questions 53 through 55 refer to the following conversation.

quarter. Do you know the reason?

their fares.（53）On top of that, we had to change the hotel we use because many
of our staff complained about being robbed during their trips. So, we signed a
contract with another chain, and they are a bit more expensive.（53）
M: Well, we are going to have to do something to tighten up around here. Tell
you what; from now on I want you to make sure you allow only those staff
members who must take trips to go on them.（54）This way, we should be able
to keep down the cost a bit.

should be allowed or not because everyone seems to have legitimate reasons
for taking the trips.（55）I think we need to find other ways to cut costs. I'm

M：好吧，我们要采取措施紧缩开支。跟你说吧，从现在起，我想让你
确保只允许必须出差的人出差。这样一来，我们应该能减少一点儿花销。
W：实际上，我们一直都是这么做的，但是很难判断哪些出差应该批
准，哪些不应该批准，因为每个人似乎都有出差的正当理由。我认为我们需
要找别的办法降低成本。我今天要和其他经理开会。我何不在会上提出这个
问题呢？

conducted last month. As you can see, the numbers are less than stellar.（68）
W: Wow, we got low marks on nearly everything. I think we'd better review
the information together.
M: I agree. But let's examine the top-rated one first to try to figure out
what we're doing correctly.（69）
W: That makes sense. Nobody's using the conference room, so we can discuss
the matter in there.
M: Okay. Let me grab a cup of coffee first.（70）This is probably going to
be a lengthy meeting.

W：你看上去有点沮丧，是不是出了什么事情？
M：贝克研究所给我们发了上个月做的客户满意度调查的结果。你看，
这些数据不是那么理想。
W：啊，我们几乎每一项得分都很低。我觉得我们最好再研究一下这份
结果。

了的。

W：有道理。现在会议室里没人，我们可以在那里讨论一下。
M：好，我先去冲杯咖啡。这可能会是一个很长的会。

extremely unappealing and make people not want to purchase our products. As

to start a new media campaign to make up for the damage that has been done at
once. I've decided to use Pembroke Advertising.（97）Janet, I want you to
contact the company at once and request that a representative be sent here. Ideally,
someone should arrive tomorrow morning.

作。珍妮特，请你迅速联系这家公司并要求其派一名代表过来。如果理想的

Questions 83 through 85 refer to the following broadcast.
I'm Jack Thompson, presenting another edition of “Tips for Your Trip”.
Christmas time is here again, so it's important for all of you making that long
drive home to be extra careful on the road.（83）So listen carefully. Firstly,
there will be many tired and stressed drivers on the road, so you will need to be
extra careful. Secondly, try to share the driving with a friend or relative or two
if possible.（84）That way there will always be someone who can take over the
steering wheel when you're tired.Thirdly, take a break when you start to notice
the effects of drowsiness—drifting, blurry vision, and yawning.（84）And
finally, remember that drinking a lot of coffee can only help you fight drowsiness
for a short time. Learn to recognize the signs of sleepiness, and stop.（84）
Have a good sleep. Don't drive after midnight if you can possibly avoid it.（84）
That's all, but please listen again next week for more“Tips for Your Trip”.

alone expand as it has done in the last sixty years. （93）You have been
chosen from a field of sixty applicants to continue that tradition, （94）and we
have faith that through your energy and positive attitude we will be able to continue
our expansion to markets all over the world.

post them in places around town then.
See Jennifer Evans perform live!
